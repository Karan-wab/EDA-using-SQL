# EDA-using-SQL
Transformed a raw electronics sales dataset into an actionable resource by executing an end-to-end analysis in SQL, where I performed data cleaning, feature engineering, and EDA to derive business insights, including the statistical relationship between product reviews and ratings.

SQL & Data Transformation: Utilized Advanced SQL to perform end-to-end ETL and analysis on a raw electronics dataset, executing complex data cleaning and transformation tasks to prepare data for analysis.

Data Cleaning & Regular Expressions: Cleaned and standardized messy text-based columns (Price, Rating) into analysis-ready numeric formats using SQL string functions (REPLACE, SUBSTRING_INDEX) and Regular Expressions (REGEXP_SUBSTR).

Feature Engineering: Engineered new, high-value features directly in SQL, including Brandname, MRP (Maximum Retail Price), and Reviews_Count, to enable deeper and more meaningful analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive EDA in SQL, performing univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to identify key business insights and product performance trends.

Statistical Analysis in SQL: Calculated key statistical metrics including covariance and correlation to quantify the relationship between variables like product ratings and review counts.

Business Intelligence & Reporting: Performed grouped summary statistics (AVG, STDDEV) to analyze brand-level pricing strategies and consistency, delivering actionable insights on market positioning.
